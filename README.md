# Turtle-Race-Game
It uses the Python turtle module to simulate a race between five turtles, each moving a random distance during each iteration. Users place a bet on which coloured turtle will win. The game determines the winner when the first turtle crosses the finish line and checks whether the user's bet is correct.
# Key Features:
- Users can bet on the winning turtle by choosing a colour.
- Five turtles move randomly across the screen.
- The game announces the winning turtle and if the user's prediction is correct.
# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (included with Python)
# Game Process:
1. A prompt asks for the user's bet (the colour of the turtle).
2. Five turtles, each with a different colour, are displayed at the starting line.
3. The turtles move towards the finish line randomly.
4. The game announces the result, stating the winner and whether the userâ€™s bet was accurate.
